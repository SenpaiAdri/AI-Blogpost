## Welcome to AI-Blogpost's official repo!

### What is AI Blogpost?
 - AI Blogpost fetches all tech related news especially in AI field, we then gather the most relevant news and then feed that to AI to make a blog post about it. This platform posts every day gathering all latest news thanks to RSS, we can fetch the most latest news and gather relevant details to feed on AI.

### What AI did you use?
 - The AI that we use in this project is Gemini 2.5 flash which is fast cost efficient.

### Why did you make this project?
 - This project has been on the back of my mind since 3rd year second sem of my college life... i found some devs used news blogging on their web portfolio but it is a small feature, so it has come to my mind that, what if we create a platform that posts everyday about latest tech news?
 - During those times, i can't start creating this project because of our thesis, so i just planned this project on my mind until i finish our thesis and my web portfolio.
 - This project is also because of my curiosity about web development, this is because i'm focused in mobile development and seen it's beauty, and now wanting to explore new things to upskill myself and add tech stacks to my resume(currently thinking if im into web dev than mobile dev XD).

 ### What is the current state of the project?
 - As of this time(January 16, 2026), this project is still under development. UI is still under development and is almost done but the AI posting generation is paused as i still have no billing account active and can't access AI agent and can't continue further because i cant test it. but i have mock data to show it's initial UI/UX.
 - for now, I'm going to focus on the UI until i have enough money to activate a billing account :>
